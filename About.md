Hi! I'm Katelyn. <br/>
I recently graduated with a BA in Environmental Sceince at HUnter College in NYC.<br/>
My focus is in Ecology and GIS. I'm most interested in understanding the relationship and interconnectedness of the human population and their local ecosystems, and how they ultimately alter one another.<br/>
<br/>
I am very passionate about my connection to nature, and in the future I aspire to channel that passion through growing food and scientific research in temperate broadleaf forests. I feed that passion currently by hiking, climbing, skiing, biking, camping, exploring, and anything else I can do to be outside. I hope to work with people who have the same love and appreciation for nature.
